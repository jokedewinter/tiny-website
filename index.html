    <h2>Some sillyness</h2>
    <p>My work explores the relationship between acquired synesthesia and life as performance.</p>
    <p>With influences as diverse as Kafka and Francis Bacon, new tensions are synthesised from both mundane and transcendant meanings.</p>
    <p>Ever since I was a teenager I have been fascinated by the essential unreality of meaning. What starts out as yearning soon becomes manipulated into a hegemony of futility, leaving only a sense of unreality and the possibility of a new beginning.</p>
    <p>As wavering phenomena become distorted through emergent and repetitive practice, the viewer is left with a hymn to the darkness of our condition.</p>
